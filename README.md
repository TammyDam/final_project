Residential and Commercial Permits in PG County

We will be using the "Residential and Commercial Permits (July 2013 to Present)" dataset from PG county
(https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Urban-Planning/Residential-and-Commercial-Permits-July-2013-to-Pr/weik-ttee). This 
provides a fulll list of residential and commericial permits that we will use to help new/prospective business owners find an
area in PG County that is best suited to start their specific business. This helps users find the least amount of competitors 
by cross referencing permit types and cities.

# Developer Manual 

<h1> Installation and Dependencies <h1>


The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
