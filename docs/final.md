Data: The data we decided to use PG County Permits 2008-Present which was provided on the county's website.

Strategies/Solution: Our solution to our information problem is to provide users with additional tools to help them further analyze different parts of the PG County dataset and help users manipulate the data using various visualization settings to compare certain pieces of data from the dataset. We are incorporating a bar chart to make the search process easier. 

Technical System Rationale: We are specifically Leaflet 

How Our Solution Works: By being able to provide our users with additional visualization tools such as a map can offer them more insight on what types of permits exist within PG county as well as enabling them the ability to gauge how many companies and types of companies are within PG county.

Challenges and Impact of Design: One of the challenges we faced was understanding and implementing the Fetch API. Another challenge we faced was learning how to use Bulma.io and Leaflet. Since it was not introduced in class, we had to research ways to seamlessly incorporate it into our project. 

Future Direction:
