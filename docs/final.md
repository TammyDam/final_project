Link to app: Need to add.

Information problem: To help companies that want to start their business to find areas with least amount of competitors cross referencing permit types and cities.

Stakeholders/target browsers: Local businesses and corporations.Our system would benefit businesses because it would provide more information on their competitors and the competitors within specific areas of PG county and What types of permits businesses they would need to obtain.

Data: The data we decided to use was PG County's Permit 2008-Present which was provided on the PG county's website.

Strategies/Solution: Our solution to our information problem is to provide users with additional tools to help them further analyze different parts of the PG County dataset and help users manipulate the data using various visualization settings to compare certain pieces of data from the dataset. We are incorporating a bar chart to make the search process easier. 

Technical System Rationale: Before using Bulma, our team decided to use Bootstrap, React, and Leaflet for our web application but after we conducted further research we realized that these libraries do not work with each other. After checking in our professor, they recommended that we use Bulma and we decided to use it because it provided lots of free templates with amazing layouts and designs. We also liked how it provided a lot of documentation on how to create a website with Bulma.

How Our Solution Works: By being able to provide our users with additional visualization tools such as a map can offer them more insight on what types of permits exist within PG county as well as enabling them the ability to gauge how many companies and types of companies are within PG county. This can provide them additonal information on whether or not they should start or expand their business within PG county. 

Challenges and Impact of Design: 

Future Direction: Some future directions would be to make a mobile app so it can be more accessible for users. We would also want to solve another information problems such as acessing the effect of the 2008-2013 recession and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.
